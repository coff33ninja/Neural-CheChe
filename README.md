# Neural CheChe: Modular AI Training System

## üéØ Overview

Neural CheChe is a professional, modular AI training system that teaches neural networks to play both Chess and Checkers through self-play, strategic discussions, and competitive evolution. The system uses a Champion-Challenger architecture where multiple AI agents learn from each other through structured competition and knowledge sharing.

- Specialized learning for each agent type
- Shared knowledge integration

### Phase 3: Challenger System (Every 5 Generations)
- Best training agent challenges champion
- Promotion if win rate > 55%
- Knowledge transfer to all agents

### Phase 4: Wildcard Challenge (Every 3 Generations)
- Champion tested against fresh AI
- Absolute skill measurement
- Progress trend analysis
